# WORDLE-VISION
_Up your Wordle game!_

Are you obsessed with playing the increasingly-popular word game <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle</a>?

Ever wondered what the optimal first word to guess might be?

As a fan of the game myself, I've done some quick analytics to try and help guide you.

Final output is a text file of 60 words (best_guesses.txt) that are good initial guesses when playing Wordle. 
The list can, with manual curation, be pared down further to only the more common words used in the game.
